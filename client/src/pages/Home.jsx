                        particular habit, but you doesn't feel pleasure while
                        doing it. Or you canot keep track it at a specific time.
                        Yeah this is for you.

                        Once you register and signed in, you can create habits
                        as much as you want. But at the beginning, we recommend
                        you to add one habit and track it daily to see the
                        progress at the end of the week, especially if you are
                        not confident enough to track multiple habits. Once you
                        finish a week, for the next week you can add the same
                        habit again without clicking start a new week. Then you
                        can even see your previous progress too. You can do this
                        again and again until you feel the taste in it. At that time, No longer focus at one habit. You
                        can just start more habits and track them. Then at the end of
                        a week, you can reset the data you stored.

                        Progress can be seen when you click on a habit and
                        scroll down, by a nice bar graph. After seeing the
                        progress at the end of a week, you can plan how you
                        should continue the habit in the next week and reset the
                        habit for starting the new week. Remember when you reset
                        the habits, the information of the week will be
                        completely deleted. The system is designed for a easy
                        approach which lets you keep watching the progress at
                        the end of a week. Because most of the people forget
                        what they did in earlier days very quickly. So, track
                        like a month is not that efficient from our viewpoint.

                        If it doesnâ€™t feel good, we recommend you to reduce the
                        time you spend and start smaller. Even though you feel
                        like you can only concentrate 1 second on a habit, start
                        by doing it for just one second. But remember whatever
                        time you choose should be closer to your best time. Not
                        the worst one. When you keep doing for that little time,
                        your strengths will be awakened, and they let you
                        improve the time on the habit. It feels like a tree
                        grows from a little tiny plant to a giant tree. Then you
                        will start to feel the taste in it and next the progress
                        will slowly start to become good.

                        Not for sure. Once your progress feels good, you can
                        continue the habit and enjoy the tracking and weekly
                        results. After sometime, you may feel you are not enjoying tracking anymore.
                        Then you stop the
                        tracking and delete the habit. Don't be messed up. Your mind will keep helping to do it. The taste. Taste has ultimate energy.

                        to do, just use multiplications of 10. When you keep
                        doing your habits, you will start to see your strengths
                        and weaknesses. When you know them, you will feel like
                        "Ohh now I can give more wider percentages, instead of giving
                        multiplications of 10". That's it.
